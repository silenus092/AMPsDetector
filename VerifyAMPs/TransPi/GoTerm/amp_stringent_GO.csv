GO:0002775,antimicrobial peptide production,biological_process,"The synthesis or release of an antimicrobial peptide during an immune response, resulting in an increase in intracellular or extracellular levels. Such peptides may have protective properties against bacteria, fungi, viruses, or protozoa."
GO:0002776,antimicrobial peptide secretion,biological_process,"The regulated release of an antimicrobial peptide from a cell or a tissue. Such peptides may have protective properties against bacteria, fungi, viruses, or protozoa."
GO:0002777,antimicrobial peptide biosynthetic process,biological_process,"The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of an antimicrobial peptide. Such peptides may have protective properties against bacteria, fungi, viruses, or protozoa."
GO:0002778,antibacterial peptide production,biological_process,"The synthesis or release of an antibacterial peptide during an immune response, resulting in an increase in intracellular or extracellular levels."
GO:0002779,antibacterial peptide secretion,biological_process,The regulated release of an antibacterial peptide from a cell or a tissue.
GO:0002780,antibacterial peptide biosynthetic process,biological_process,The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of an antibacterial peptide.
GO:0002781,antifungal peptide production,biological_process,"The synthesis or release of an antifungal peptide during an immune response, resulting in an increase in intracellular or extracellular levels."
GO:0002782,antifungal peptide secretion,biological_process,The regulated release of an antifungal peptide from a cell or a tissue.
GO:0002783,antifungal peptide biosynthetic process,biological_process,The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of an antifungal peptide.
GO:0045087,innate immune response,biological_process,Innate immune responses are defense responses mediated by germline encoded components that directly recognize components of potential pathogens.
GO:0061760,antifungal innate immune response,biological_process,An defense response against a fungus mediated through an innate immune response. An innate immune response is mediated by germline encoded components that directly recognize components of potential pathogens.
GO:0140367,antibacterial innate immune response,biological_process,An defense response against a bacteria mediated through an innate immune response. An innate immune response is mediated by germline encoded components that directly recognize components of potential pathogens.
GO:0140374,antiviral innate immune response,biological_process,A defense response against viruses mediated through an innate immune response. An innate immune response is mediated by germline encoded components that directly recognize components of potential pathogens.
